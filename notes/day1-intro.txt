Bitmap vs Vector

Bitmap:
	Raster images
	Pixel Based
	Mapped to a grid
	Each Px is a color and can be edited
	Bitmap Data is color and location
	Not easily scalable
	Good for photorealistic images

Vector:
	Mathematically-created
	Smooth Edges
	Creates curves or shapes
	Good for precise illustrations.
	Easily Scalable

COLORS

Primary Colors
	The Additive Colors
	Red, Green, Blue

	Subtractive Colors
		4 types
		CMYK (think printer colors)

	Colors that lie opposite each other on the color wheel are referred to as complementary colors.

	Every pixel in an image has two data fields
	Location and Color


	BIT DEPTH
		Bit depth refers to the number of colors that can be displayed.

		A bit is 0 or 1. The more bits available to describe the color, the more color combinations are possible.

		As a side effect, file size increases dramatically as you increase bit Depth.

	How many colors can HUMANS see?
		Humans can distinguish between 10,000,000 shades.

	Index Color and Dithering
		Index Color is a color mode using 8-bit image. The mode has a limited pallette of up to 256 colors.

		Index Color allows us to be smart about reducing file size. The more colors allowed, the better an image looks.

		This forces the computer to approximate non-included colors, by mixing pixels of 2 or more colors from the palette to give the illusion of another color.

		This is called DITHERING.

	Color Management
		HUE
			What most people think about "color". The generic name used to describe 'red', 'green', 'blue'.
		SATURATION
			Refers to how pure the color is. A fully saturated color is the truest version of the color.
		BRIGHTNESS
			Amount of white in a color.


	Resolution
		Refers to the number of pixels per unit of measurement printed on a page.
