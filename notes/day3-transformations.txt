Perspective
	In context of vision and visual perception, is the way in which objects appear to the eye based on their spatial attributes.

	Linear Perspective
		As objects move further away from the viewer they appear smaller.

	Graphical Perspective
		An approximate representation of an image drawn on a flat surface. Essentially an illusion.

		Two characteristic features of drawn perspective:
			Smaller as distance from observer increases.
			Foreshortened: the size of an objects dimensions along the line of sight are relatively shorter than dimensions across the line of sight.


	VANISHING POINTS
		One Point Perspective
			Typically used for roads, as they dissappear shrink into the distance.

		Two Point Perspective
			Used to draw the same objects as one-point perspective rotated.
			For Example:
				Looking at the corner of a house.
