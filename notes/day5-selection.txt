DAY 5
Selections

A selection isolates one or more parts of your image. This allows you to be
very specific with the way you apply effects and filters to your image.

MARQUEE TOOLS
Rectangle
	Lets you select a square area
Elliptical
	Lets you select a circular area.

LASSO TOOLS
	The lasso tool is a freeform selection tool. It's great for creating an initial rough selection and it is is even better for cleaning up an existing selection.
