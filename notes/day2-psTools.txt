RESAMPLING
	Resampling allows you to change print dimensions and resolution
	independently.

THE CANVAS
	The CANVAS SIZE is the full editable area of an image.
	The *CanvasSize* Command lets you increase or decrease your
	canvas size.
	If you increase the canvas size of an image with a transparent
	background, the added canvas is transparent. 

CROPPING AND STRAIGHTENING
	Adjusting your image usually requires you to lose part of the image.
	Photoshop gives you the *RULER* tool and the *CROP* Tool.
